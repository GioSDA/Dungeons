# GioSDA's Dungeons Plugin

This plugin was initially made for a server called MeteoritePVP, however that server is now defunct so I am releasing the plugin's source code for anyone to use.

## Features:
- Dungeons can be added automatically into a generating world
- Dungeons can be modified through config and the file system
- Use `/dungeon create` over a selected WorldEdit area in order to make that dungeon appear throughout the world
- Use `/dungeon chance` to select the chance for a chunk to spawn a dungeon

This plugin is not being maintained.
